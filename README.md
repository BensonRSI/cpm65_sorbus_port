CP/M-65
=======

What?
-----

This is a native port of Digital Research's seminal 1977 operating system CP/M
to the 6502. So far it runs on:

  - BBC Micro (and Master, and Tube)
  - Commodore 64

Unlike the original, it supports relocatable binaries, so allowing unmodified
binaries to run on any system: this is necessary as 6502 systems tend to be
much less standardised than 8080 and Z80 systems. On the BBC Micro in mode 7
you get a 21kB TPA, on the Master you get about 25kB, and on the C64 you get
46kB. A BBC Tube system will give you just under 57kB, which is nice.

Currently you can cross-assemble programs from a PC, as well as a working C
toolchain with llvm-mos. I plan on finding an assembler and editor which will
run natively for full native development support.

No, it won't let you run 8080 programs on the 6502!

Why?

Why not?


Where?
------

It's [open source on GitHub!](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65)


How?
----

You will need the [llvm-mos](https://llvm-mos.org) toolchain. CP/M-65 support
is available out of the box. Once installed, you should just be able to run the
Makefile and you'll get bootable disk images for the Commodore 64 (with 1541
drive) and BBC Micro (producing a 200kB SSSD DFS disk).

BBC Micro notes:

  - it'll autodetect the amount of available memory. If you're on a Master or
	Tube system, I'd suggest making sure you're in mode 0 or 3 before running.
	On a BBC Micro... well, it _will_ run in mode 0, but you'll only get a
	2.5kB TPA! I suggest mode 7.

  - the CP/M file system is stored in a big file (called cpmfs). This will
	expand up to the size defined in diskdefs: currently, 192kB (the largest
	that will fit on a SSSD disk). All disk access is done through MOS so you
	should be able to use a ramdisk, hard disk, Econet, ADFS, VDFS, etc. If so,
	you'll want to define your own disk format and adjust the drive definition
	in the BIOS to get more space.

Commodore 64 notes:

  - it's excruciatingly slow as it uses normal 1541 disk accesses at 300 bytes
	per second. Everything works, but you won't enjoy it. At some point I want
	to add a fastloader.

  - the disk image produced is a hybrid of a CP/M file system and a CBMDOS file
	system, which can be accessed as either. The disk structures used by the
	other file system are hidden. You get about 170kB on a normal disk.

  - disk accesses are done using direct block access, so it _won't_ work on
	anything other than a 1541. Sorry.

Supported programs:

You don't get a lot right now. As transients, you get `DUMP`, `STAT` and
`SUBMIT`.  There's also a `BITMAP`, which is for debugging and I'm going to
remove it. I'd love more --- send me pull requests! The build system supports
cc65 assembler and llvm-mos C programs.

In the CCP, you get the usual `DIR`, `ERA`, `TYPE` and `USER`. There is no
`SAVE` as on the relocatable CP/M-65 system, assembling images in memory is of
questionable utility, but there's a new `FREE` command which shows memory
usage.

Pokey the Penguin loves to read your [pull
requests](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65/compare)!
